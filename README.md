# mermaid flowchart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mermaidjs/flowchart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mermaidjs/flowchart)

This project is my endeavour to rewrite [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) flowchart.


## Why?

I am the main contributor of the mermaid project.
I often find it hard to fix bugs or add new features.
I believe it should be implemented in a simpler way.


## Setup

```
yarn install
```


## Test

```
yarn test
```


## Dev

Run the following command and see the flowcharts in browser:

```
yarn dev
```


## Todo

- Auto figure out graph size
